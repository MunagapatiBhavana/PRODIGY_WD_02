I have developed a stopwatch web application using HTML,CSS and Javascript. 
The foundation of the application is laid out using HTML, ensuring clear and organized elements for user interaction.By implementing functions for start, stop, pause, reset, and laps, users can accurately measure time intervals to meet their needs.: The user interface is enhanced with CSS styling, providing a visually appealing and intuitive experience.
Whether you're timing workouts, cooking, or tracking study sessions, this stopwatch application is your reliable companion!
